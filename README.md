The beat counter displays which beat you are on. You can select the number of divisions in the grid (16/32) and change the tempo with the slider.

## Grid Controls

The main grid allows you to control the volume of the individual track and begin customising your own beats

The mute & solo controls will allow you to focus on specific tracks and hush the ones you don't want to hear.

Use the All option to toggle the whole grid for that track.

# Future Features

This is my first large-scale (for me!) project using JavaScript and a way for me to put into practice what I have been learning over the last few months. It was a project designed to reinforce my knowledge and push me to discover solutions to make features work. I work in music so I had clear vision of what I wanted the app to do and how it should do it. I made real efforts to follow the DRY principle and reformat code as I went along - this really helped me to discover ways to make my code efficient and avoid repitions.

I was careful to ensure the app is easily expandable in the future. It is possible to add more instruments, samples & presets without editing very much current code.

This was also a valuable lesson in CSS for me. Up to this project CSS had been an afterthought on my projects and I had mostly fumbled my way through it, with a trial-and-error approach. I tried to follow best practices with my CSS also to the best of my knowledge.

In the future I intend to continue adding more featurtes to this app including:

- Extra drum kits samples
- Include more instruments
- Include more presets
- Add an option to save your own beats (using local storage)
